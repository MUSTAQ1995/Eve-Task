# Front-end Coding Challenge:

# This project is created with the command "npx create-react-app app-name".

# I have installed the SASS externally to use in my project. Which is a CSS pre-processor.

  Here I have tried to create a  project which is responsive and UI look is same as mentioned in the challenge.
  And for the functionslity I have used the "useState", hook which is inbuild hook of react, for state manipulation.

# To check the result for development  mode:
  * clone the repository with the command : "git clone https://github.com/MUSTAQ1995/Eve-Task.git".
  * Then navigate to the Eve-Task  and first run "npm install" after compeltion of install then run "npm start", then you can see the result in developent mode.
  
# To check the result in Production mode:
  * clone the repository with the command : "git clone https://github.com/MUSTAQ1995/Eve-Task.git".
  * Then navigate to the Eve-Task  and first run "npm install" after compeltion of install then run "serve -s build", then you can see the result in production mode.

# Technologies used:
  * As mentioned in the instruction I have used, ReactJS, HTML and SASS, to complete the challenge.
  
# Breakpoints for the Responsive Design:
  * For Mobiles which are equal or less than 600px in screen width, I have showed accoring to the design.
  * For tablets I have made two breakpoints at 768px and 1024px for the tablets, accroding to the design.
  * For Laptops at screen width 1366px and at the screen width 1440px, made it as accroing to the design.
  * For Desktop at screen width 1920px the design fit good.

# Production error:
    While trying to run the production mode it was saying that,"cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system". 
    To solve this issue I have used this command,"powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned".
